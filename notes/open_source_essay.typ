= Open Source: an opportunity for Europe

Open Source projects offer a compelling model for sharing software and fostering 
collaboration. Europe has both the opportunity and the necessity to invest in 
initiatives related to Open Source development. 
*Such investments can enhance the European software ecosystem, drive 
innovation, and lead to significant economic and technological benefits.*

== What is Open Source?

Open Source means that the source code of a library or application is freely 
available for use, modification, and distribution. While users can utilize the 
software as they see fit, there are different licenses that preserve the 
author's rights and outline specific obligations. These licenses help maintain 
a balance between freedom of use and intellectual property protection.

== Benefits of Open Source

Open Source projects allow companies that develop or use software to share 
common libraries, fostering collaboration and reducing redundancy. 
Instead of multiple companies independently developing libraries that solve the 
same problem, they can contribute to a single Open Source project. 
This collaborative approach:

- *Saves Resources*: Reduces the need for duplicate development efforts.
- *Accelerates Innovation*: Combines expertise from various sources to enhance 
    the quality and functionality of the software.
- *Enhances Customization*: Allows companies to build adapters around the 
    shared library to better fit their specific platforms.

== Maintainers

While Open Source projects are often shared among many contributors, managing 
their development can be challenging. To address this, *I propose that Europe 
funds deserving Open Source projects, enabling maintainers to be hired to 
oversee them*.
The maintainers' responsibilities would include:

- *Improving the Library*: Acting on instructions and requests from European 
    companies, tracked through issues or tickets.
- *Proposing Use Cases*: Identifying new applications and opportunities for 
    the library.
- *Updating Documentation*: Ensuring that all documentation is current and 
    accessible.

== Funding Mechanism

Inspired by Spotify's method of compensating creators, *Open Source projects 
should receive funds based on the level of engagement from European companies*. 
Two possible approaches are:

+ *Issue-Based Funding*: Projects receive funds proportional to the number of 
  issues opened by European companies.
+ *Voting System*: Companies have votes proportional to their number of 
    employees or other metrics. They can vote for the projects or issues they
    want to be solved.

*Why Is This a Good Idea?*

- *Alignment with Demand*: Funding is directed toward projects and issues that 
    are most relevant to the needs of European companies.
- *Fair Resource Allocation*: Companies with greater usage and reliance on Open 
    Source projects have a proportionate influence on funding decisions.
- *Incentivizes Quality and Responsiveness*: Maintainers are motivated to 
    address the most pressing issues, improving overall software quality.

== How are the usage data obtained?

Most Open Source projects are hosted on GitHub, an online platform for storing 
and sharing code. By collaborating with GitHub, Europe could obtain the 
necessary data to distribute funds effectively among projects.  
However, developing a European platform to manage these projects may offer 
additional benefits:

- *Data Efficiency*: A dedicated platform would allow for more effective and 
    efficient data collection.
- *Intellectual Property Protection*: Ensures that software is available for 
    research while preserving the intellectual property rights of European 
    contributors.
- *Autonomy*: Reduces reliance on a private company (GitHub is owned by 
    Microsoft) that may have conflicting interests.

== How can the funds be used?

Since Europe would be investing in these projects, it has the right to establish 
clear and definitive license agreements. Funds could be used to:

- *Provide Salaries*: Compensate maintainers who reside in Europe.
- *Cover Management Expenses*: Support other costs related to project 
    management on a monthly basis.
- *Implement Time-Limited Funding*: Unspent funds after a certain period are 
    revoked, ensuring efficient use.
- *Performance-Based Compensation*: Alternatively, maintainers could be paid 
    based on the number of resolved issues.

I have virtually no experience in this field, therefore you can come up with
better and more detailed ideas.

== Preventing Monopolies in Open Source Projects


There is a risk that European companies might dominate the development of 
Open Source projects they fund, similar to how global companies like Google, 
Meta, or Microsoft influence Open Source projects to meet their needs. 
To prevent this:

- *Develop a Robust Voting System*: Create a transparent and fair system that 
    balances the interests of all stakeholders.
- *Ensure Diverse Representation*: Include input from small and 
    medium-sized enterprises, public entities, and individual contributors.
- *Set Governance Policies*: Establish rules that prevent any single entity 
    from having disproportionate control over a project's direction.

== Conclusion

*Investing in Open Source is in Europe's best interest*. 
Such an initiative benefits not just companies but also public entities, 
foundations, private citizens, and any organization that uses software. 
By strengthening the European software ecosystem, Europe can:

- *Enhance IT Infrastructure*: Build a more robust and secure technological 
    foundation.
- *Foster Tech Culture*: Encourage innovation and collaboration across the 
    continent.
- *Optimize Resource Allocation*: Save money and developer time, allowing 
    focus on creating innovative products rather than redundant libraries.

In summary, a strategic investment in Open Source projects can drive significant 
advancements in Europe's technological capabilities, benefiting the entire 
society.\
Finally, I want to point out that other countries are already investing in this field, for example, Switzerland requires all government software to be Open Source
