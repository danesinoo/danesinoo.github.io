title: Guide for Moving to Copenhagen
---

This guide is intended to help with moving to Copenhagen. I hope it will be useful in the future if I move to another city as a starting point.

## 1. Why Move to Copenhagen?

Copenhagen is an expensive city, so you need a solid reason to move here, such as:

- A job
- Enrollment in a university

Until you have at least one of these reasons, it's best to wait.  
This means the first step to moving here is **finding a job or getting admitted to a university**.  
Personally, I consider this the hardest step.

## 2. Finding a Place to Live

Once you've secured a reason to move, the next biggest challenge is finding accommodation.  

### Choosing a Location
- The search for housing should happen **after** securing work or university admission.
- Choose a location **close to your university or workplace** to save time, money, and avoid long commutes, especially in winter.
  
### Setting Preferences
Before searching, prepare a **list of essential requirements** for your accommodation.  
For example, my criteria when looking for housing in Copenhagen were:

#### **Must-have Features**:
- A private room
- Rent under **5000 DKK (including all expenses)**
- **Within 30 minutes** of the university
  - If farther, rent should be **under 4500 DKK**
  - **Never more than 1 hour away** from the university
- Acceptable transportation options:
  - Metro
  - S-train (similar to a tram)
  - Bicycle
  - Walking  
  ðŸš« **I dislike buses**.

Any place that doesnâ€™t meet these criteria is not considered.

#### **Nice-to-have Features**:
- Living with other students
- A well-equipped kitchen (oven, freezer, plenty of utensils)
- A dishwasher (especially if there are 4+ people)
- A desk or table in the room
- At least **15 mÂ²** of room space
- A **wide bed** (120cm+)
- A comfortable **living room**
  
Other appreciated features:
- Balcony, garden, nice view
- Bike parking
- Dishwasher, dryer, microwave
- Speakers, gym, etc.

### Writing a Personal Introduction
Since many students look for roommates, landlords often ask for a short **self-introduction**.  
Prepare a short description about yourself to improve your chances of getting a place.

## 3. How to Find Accommodation

There are two main ways to find a place in Copenhagen:  

### **1. Facebook Groups**
You can find accommodation by **messaging landlords and tenants** on Facebook groups.  
Some useful groups include:
- **Find Room / Roommate in Copenhagen**
- **Room/Apartment/Housing/Student Accommodation in Copenhagen, Denmark**
- **Rent House / Apartment in Copenhagen**
- **Leje i KÃ¸benhavn - Rooms for rent in Copenhagen**

### **2. Housing Agencies**
Another option is to use **rental agencies**, which provide a list of available apartments.  
You select the ones you're interested in and **join a waiting list**.  
- This is the **safest and cheapest method**, but it can take time.
- **Never pay before viewing the apartment**.

Some agencies require you to be a student:  
- **[Housing Foundation](https://housingfoundation.dk/)** â€“ Expensive, but easier to secure a spot.  
- **[Kollegiernes Kontor](https://www.kollegierneskontor.dk/)** â€“ More affordable.  
- **[CIU](https://www.s.dk/)** â€“ Also more affordable.  

Most students find housing this way, so it's a common and reliable method.

## 4. Registering as a Resident

Once you've found a place to live, you need to **register your residence**.  

### **Step 1: Get a Residence Permit**
If you plan to stay in Denmark for more than 3 months, you must notify the authorities.  
More details can be found here:

### **Step 2: Get a CPR Number**
The **CPR number** is equivalent to the **Italian codice fiscale**.  
- Apply for a CPR number here:

- Note:  
  - The **residence permit** is requested in Copenhagen.  
  - The **CPR number** is requested from the **Kommune (municipality)** where you live.  

### **Step 3: Access Danish Services**
Once you have a CPR number, you can:
- Use the **MitID app** to access all Danish services.
- Receive the **sundhedskort** (Danish health card), which allows you to:
  - Buy prescribed medication.
  - Get assigned to a general practitioner.

## 5. Final Steps

After obtaining the **CPR number**, you should complete a few additional steps to fully integrate:

1. **Get a Danish phone number**  
2. **Open a Danish bank account**

3. **Get a Rejsekort** (public transport card)  
   - This card makes traveling easier as it works for all Danish public transport.
