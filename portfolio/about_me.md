## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Carlo

I'm a **Computer Scientist** and software developer from Italy&#x1f1ee;&#x1f1f9; 

I enjoy writing code that **automates workflows**, simplifies tasks, or just 
explore ideas.  
Coding teaches you precision â€” you're not just giving instructions, you're 
**convincing the compiler** to share your vision.  
Thatâ€™s why I like working with Rust. Itâ€™s strict, but fair â€” and it always makes 
me think better.

Outside of tech, Iâ€™m into **reading** (currently: *Resurrection*, 
*The Vegetarian*, *Tristes Tropiques*) and **journaling** â€” a way to untangle 
ideas and track the ones worth chasing.

I chose Computer Science because itâ€™s a field full of hobbies â€” all you really 
need is time and curiosity.

## ðŸŽ“ Education

I earned my **Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science** from the University of Padua in 
2024, and now Iâ€™m doing a **Masterâ€™s** at the University of Copenhagen.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been focused on **machine learning** and **protein structures** 
â€” two very different fields, both trying to make sense of **black boxes**.
