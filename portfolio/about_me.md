title: About

Hello! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm Carlo, a passionate **Computer Scientist** and software developer from
Italy &#x1f1ee;&#x1f1f9;  

I love creating software to **automate my workflow** (yes, I am a vim user). 
I found out you need to be very precise when you code, because everything you 
write is going to happen strictly as you wrote it.  
I am **currently reading** papers about the field and interesting books such as
Resurrection, The Vegetarian or Tristes Tropiques. Sometimes I also write
shallow thoughts and my daily life on my blog (that's why I developed this
cool template).  
Basically, I picked computer science, because I think it is effectively the most
useful thing for me, and I don't mean it career-wise: PCs are the core of
our society. Without them, we wouldn't be able to organize ourselves.

## Education

I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Padua's University
in 2024. Then, I started the Master's in the same field at the University of 
Copenhagen. 
My main interest is **machine learning**, indeed during the Bachelor's I 
completed an internship on models' comparison. 
I liked it so much that I am going to 
follow **Online and Reinforcement Learning** and Machine Learning B.  
I am generally enthusiastic about science. Thus, I will follow also the
course called **Integrative and Structural Biology**.
