= Engaging Self-Introduction

== Opening Hook
Hi! I’m Carlo Rosso—a passionate Computer Science Master’s student at KU,
specializing in Machine Learning and Software Development. If you're looking for
someone who thrives at the intersection of cutting-edge AI and efficient
software solutions, you're in the right place!

== 🔍 What Am I Looking For?
I’m on the hunt for a role where I can bridge Machine Learning and Software
Development—adapting open-source models to solve real business challenges. My
goal? To design powerful pipelines and workflows that boost productivity
and bring tangible value to your team.

== 🚀 Where Did My Journey Begin?
I earned my Bachelor’s in Padua—a vibrant university city with over
70,000 students. But I wanted more: a global perspective and a dynamic tech
environment. That’s why I moved to Copenhagen to pursue my Master’s at KU,
deepening my expertise in AI and software innovation.

== 💡My Most Inspiring Experience

One of my most exciting projects was interning with Professor Giovanni Da San
Martino at the University of Padua. We researched AI-driven fact-checking and
media propaganda detection. My work? Comparing Recurrent Neural Networks, Tree
Kernel Methods, and Large Language Models for Sentiment Analysis—an incredible
deep dive into NLP’s real-world impact.

== How Do I Spend My Free Time?

When I’m not coding or reading ML papers, I’m building a startup to boost Open
Source collaboration in Europe.
I am also into sci-fi and fantasy books like The Foundation or Game Of
Thrones. Always with great techno music in the background.

== Closing with a Call to Action:

If you’re looking for a driven, curious, and solutions-focused ML/Software
Engineer—let’s connect! I’d love to explore how I can contribute to your team.
