title: A combined computational and structural model of the full-length human
prolactin receptor
---

---

# Prolactin Receptor PRLR

Linked to:
- reproduction
- cell differentiation to immune system responses
- reproductive disorders
- breast and prostate tumorgenesis

---

# Divide-and-Conquer approach

The protein is very big, so it is divided in three:
- ICD: intracellular domain (20%)
- TDM: TM domain (10%)
- ECD: extracellular domain (70%)

# Divide-and-Conquer approach

---

# Why this approach

- Difficult dimerization

---

# TDM with NMR spectroscopy

---

# ECD with SAXS

# relate to methods/results/conclusions you do not understand in the paper

---

# relating to the paper and that you know the answer to (but they may not)

---

# questions on the use of methods in relation to integrative structural biology
