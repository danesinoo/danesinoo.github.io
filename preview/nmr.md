title: Nuclear Magnetic Resognance Practical
---

---

# Purpose

- We took part for one day at a bigger research 
- Recently it was found out that Oxygen can have regulatory functions
- Determine oxidation rates of TPH2's residues
- The protein: ```MQPAMMMFSS KYWARRGFSL DSAVPEEHQL LGSSTLNKPN SGKNDDK```

---

# Setup
+ We were split into 2 groups of 4 people
+ We followed a researcher, who explained the process
+ We kept any metal device away

---

# Experiment
+ We inserted the protein TPH2 in the magnet
+ We measured relationship between the Hydrogen's nuclei number and
  the Nitrogen's nuclei number
+ We insert \\( H_2 O_2 \\) into the protein solution, and we repeat the measurement
+ During the measurement, the researcher set up the magnetic signals to prevent 
  water's noise: water has a lot of hydrogen

---

# Data Analysis
+ We used the program [CCPN
  Analysis](https://ccpn.ac.uk/software/version-2/version-2-downloads/) to check 
  which residues reacts with the oxygen

# Conclusions

- Similar and close residues reacts in similar ways
