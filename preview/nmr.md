title: Nuclear Magnetic Resognance Practical
---

---

# Purpose

- We took part for one day at a bigger research. 
- Recently it was found out that Oxygen can have regulatory functions. 
- Determine oxidation rates of TPH2's residues.
- The protein: MQPAMMMFSS KYWARRGFSL DSAVPEEHQL LGSSTLNKPN SGKNDDK

---

# Setup
+ We were split into 2 groups of 4 people.
+ We followed a researcher, who explained the process.
+ We kept any metal device away.

---

# Experiment
+ We inserted the protein TPH2 in the magnet. 
+ We measured relationship between the Hydrogen's nuclei number and 
  the Nitrogen's nuclei number.
+ We insert H2O2 into the protein solution, and we repeat the measurement.
+ During the measurement, the researcher set up the magnetic signals to prevent 
  water's noise: water has a lot of hydrogen.

---

# Data Analysis
+ We used the program (CCPN Analysis) to check which residues reacts with the 
  oxygen.
