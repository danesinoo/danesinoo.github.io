title: Open Source: a Strategic Opportunity for Europe
---

Open Source projects offer a compelling model for sharing software and fostering
collaboration. Europe has both the opportunity and the necessity to invest in
initiatives related to Open Source development. **Such investments can enhance
the European software ecosystem, drive innovation, and lead to significant
economic and technological benefits.**

# Introduction

## The significance of Open Source in modern software development

The goal of the presentation is to highlight the reasons why Europe should
invest in Open Source projects.

---

# What is Open Source?

- **Definition**: Open Source software allows free access, modification, and 
    distribution of source code.

- **Licenses**: Different licenses preserve authors' rights and set usage 
    obligations.

- **Balances of Interests**: Freedom of use vs. intellectual property 
    protection.

---

# The Current Open Source Landscape

- **Global Prevalence**: Majority of projects hosted on platforms like GitHub.
- **Dominance of Non-European Entities**: Influence of companies like Microsoft 
    (owner of GitHub), Google, and Meta.
- **Risks**: Potential misuse of European intellectual property.

---

# Benefits of Open Source

- **Resource Efficiency**: Shared development reduces duplicate efforts.
- **Accelerated Innovation**: Collective expertise enhances software quality.
- **Customization**: Ability to adapt shared libraries to specific platforms.

---

# Challenges in Open Source Development

- **Management Complexity**: Difficulties in coordinating multiple contributors.
- **Funding Limitations**: Reliance on volunteer maintainers.
- **Risk of Monopolization**: Large companies influencing project directions 
    for their benefit.

---

# Proposed Solution

- **European Investment**: Funding deserving Open Source projects.
- **Hiring Maintainers**: Professional oversight to guide development.
- **Developing a European Platform**: Enhance data management and IP protection.

---

# Funding Mechanisms
- **Issue-Based Funding**: Funds allocated based on issues opened by European 
    companies.
- **Voting System**: Companies vote on projects/issues, weighted by employee 
    count.
- **Alignment with Demand**: Ensures funding reflects actual needs.

---

# Why This Funding Model Works
- **Demand-Driven**: Focuses on projects that matter most to stakeholders.
- **Fair Resource Allocation**: Proportional influence prevents dominance by 
    any single entity.
- **Incentivizes Quality**: Maintainers motivated to resolve high-priority issues.

---

# Utilization of Funds
- **Salaries for Maintainers**: Support for professionals residing in Europe.
- **Project Management Expenses**: Cover operational costs on a monthly basis.
- **Efficiency Measures**: Time-limited funding to encourage prompt use.

---

# Managing Intellectual Property
- **Clear Licensing Agreements**: Establishing rights and obligations upfront.
- **Protection of European IP**: Ensuring contributors' work is safeguarded.
- **Facilitating Research**: Balancing openness with IP preservation.

---

# Preventing Monopolies
- **Robust Voting System**: Transparent and fair decision-making processes.
- **Inclusive Governance**: Representation from SMEs, public entities, and 
    individuals.
- **Policy Framework**: Rules to prevent disproportionate control.

---

# Benefits for Europe
- **Enhanced IT Infrastructure**: Building a robust technological foundation.
- **Fostering Tech Culture**: Encouraging collaboration and innovation.
- **Economic Advantages**: Cost savings and better resource allocation.

---

# Call to Action
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Encourage companies and entities to support the 
    initiative.
- **Next Steps**: Outline a roadmap for implementation.
- **Invitation for Collaboration**: Open doors for feedback and participation.

---

# Conclusion
- **Recap of Key Points** Summarize the strategic importance of investing in 
    Open Source.
- **Final Thoughts**: Emphasize the potential long-term benefits.
